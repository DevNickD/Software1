     * This start method is used to load the fxml for the Main screen
     *
     * The application is useful but could use some future enhancements to extend functionality
     * One enhancement would be to add a button to the main screen product table that will
     * remove all associated parts from a product. That way, the user won't need to select
     * the modify button, go to a new screen and remove the parts one by one.
     *
     * Another enhancement that can be done is the ability to select and add multiple parts
     * from the top table in the Add Product and Modify Product Screens. If a product contains
     * a large amount of associated parts then it will be very tedious to have to add the parts
     * to the product one at a time.
     *
     * Some Errors occurred during the project. One error was that associated parts were able to be
     * added to the bottom table in the Add Product and Modify Product Screens. However, after saving
     * and returning to the product to modify, the associated parts weren't showing up. I realized my
     * code needed to be changed because I was just adding parts to the tableview but there was no code
     * implemented for the product itself to add the associated parts to it's Observable List.
     *
     * Another Error from a simple mistake occurred when I had a missing break statement from case 4 in
     * the Modify Product Controller. This caused a second alert messages to display after the first one
     * which wasn't supposed to happen.
     *
     * A third error was an error related to JavaFX. In the Modify Part Screen of the Application I
     * couldn't get the labels to swap based on radio button selection even though the logic seemed
     * correct for the method. I was confused for a while but the I decided to double check the fxml
     * file and noticed I never saved the action event modInHouseSelected in the ModifyPart.fxml file.
     * The onAction field was just blank then it all made sense to me.
     *
     * One more error I remember having was that the name field is blank message appeared on all Screens
     * except the Modify Part Screen. I forgot to add a branch statement to implement that functionality.
     * Even though the alert functionality existed in the alert method, I wasn't making use of it in the
     * onActionSave Method.
